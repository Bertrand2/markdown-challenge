## A funny story

Once, during a scout hike, a dog started to follow us in a village. We thought he would only follow us for a few meters, but he still was by our side in the next village. He entered a yard, so we thought it was it, but he came back a few seconds later. In total, the dog stayed with us for more than 10 kilometers until some local people took him to try and find his owner.

### TL;DR

A dog walked with my group for more than 10 kilometers even though he didn't know us.
